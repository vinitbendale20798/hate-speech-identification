# hate-speech-identification
This repository consists of the code and related files for a small project on identifying hate speech on social media platforms. This one particularly intends to classify tweets as hate and non-hate.
The main file to be executed is the 'project.py' file under 'hate-speech-identification'.
The 'src' folder contains code files for other modules in the project such as 'ban.py' for classifying the tweets to be banned based on the predictions, 'cat.py' for categorization of the tweets as bad, worst or extreme and 'models.py' for training the machine-learning models used in the project.
The 'data' folder contains the datasets required to train and test the models.
The 'outputs' folder contains the outputs of the project, like hate-speech tweets, non-hate-speech tweets, banned tweets and prediction algorithm outputs.
The 'saved_models' folder consists of the trained models which are saved in order to reduce the time required to train the models in each execution cycle.
